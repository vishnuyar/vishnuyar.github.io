  I am vishnu yarmaneni, an aspiring data scientist. Now, enrolled in Lambda School
  
  I moved into the world of investments after graduating as an electronics engineer.
  
  I dabbled in crytocurrency and then moved into management
  
  I believe that Data Science is the answer to most of the management problems. I have the business knowledge to ask the right questions. Now, I want to gain the necessary knowledge to give the right answers.
