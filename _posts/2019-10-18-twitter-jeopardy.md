What do you do when you access to Twitter API and you are data scientist. Ofcourse you build [Twitter Jeopardy Game](http://twitter.vishnuyar.com)

Using Logistic Regression,you create a model which compares the tweets of twitter users using embeddings of Basilica API.

Now, you play the game, ask the model which user will tweet your favorite text. Voila, you have Twitter Jeopardy.

Not happy with the current Players, add your own players, hell you can add yourself :)

Have a go at it, if you have complaints, ask the game who will tweet those complaints.

I developed this flask web application as part of Lambda School curriculum in less than 5 days. You can looked at the [source code](https://github.com/vishnuyar/tweeton)
