Today, I came across an interesting [dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/datasets/csv/supreme_court/supreme_court.csv). 
It contains all the relevant data about US Supreme Court cases. I always thought law was boring but the dataset piqued my interest.

The database to which this introduction pertains spans all four centuries of the Court's decisions,
from its first decision in 1791 to the Court's most recent decision. This dataset is a result of extraordinary work done by Harold J. Spaeth, Distinguished University Professor, emeritus, Michigan State University

Now, that the introduction of the dataset has been done, Let's see what interesting nuggets we come across.

> We have a total of 8893 court cases data here. The earliest court case decision is from November 1946 and the latest is from June 2018
