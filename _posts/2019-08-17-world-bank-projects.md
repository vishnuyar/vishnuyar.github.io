The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) provides financing and services to low and middle-income countries to support development and change. Development projects are implemented by borrowing countries following certain rules and procedures to guarantee that the money reaches its intended target.

The data of the World Bank Projects is available on their website. My intention is explore this dataset and notice ( if any), how the lending projects have evolved over the last 50 years.
