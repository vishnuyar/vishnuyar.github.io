The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) provides financing and services to low and middle-income countries to support development and change. Development projects are implemented by borrowing countries following certain rules and procedures to guarantee that the money reaches its intended target.

The data of the World Bank Projects is made publicly available and can be downloaded from [here].(http://search.worldbank.org/api/projects/all.csv)  My intention is to explore this dataset and notice ( if any), how the lending projects have evolved over the last 50 years.

>Let us look at the current status of 18992 projects at world bank.

Only 5.3% projects have been dropped which is commendable.

>Next, we look at the lending by world bank by regions.

![Regionwise Lending](/img/lending_regions.png)

In the 60's a majority of lending was given to Latin America and currently it is in Africa region. Lending to Asia has also comed down a bit. It resonates with development of these regions in these 5 decades.
